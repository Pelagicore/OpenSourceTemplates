# OpenSourceTemplates
A set of templates that aim to follow community best practices around 
releasing open source software.

The goal of the files in this repo is to provide a starting point for
licensing and coyright texts in source. 

Please feel free to use these templates for text and headers in your
own project and feel free to send patches on improvements if you've
got them. Perhaps begin with our CONTRIBUTING.md file?

## Resources

In our example directory we have some examples on how to list
copyright and license on a per-file basis. We use the SPDX "short tag"
format for this. SPDX license identifiers for various licenses are
available here; https://spdx.org/licenses/
